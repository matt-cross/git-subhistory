		# the new synthetic parent commit that's been rewritten as a Main commit, but
		# with the subtree overwritten.
		# - Complication: there can be >1 parent, with different Main trees. Luckily,
		#   differences in Main trees could only possibly come from Main commits that
		#   are ancestors of HEAD [FN1], which must have been merged at some point in
		#   the history of HEAD, since HEAD itself is a single commit. Finding the
		#   earliest such merge that won't conflict with HEAD is nontrivial, since the
		#   same two commits could be merged in any number of commits with any tree at
		#   all. Leave finding the earliest merged tree as TODO, for now if all parent
		#   Main trees are the same use that [FN2], otherwise just use the default
		#   Main tree guaranteed not to merge conflict with HEAD [FN3].
		#   + [FN1]: others weren't split into ancestors of SPLIT_HEAD, and hence
		#     aren't in the split-to-orig-map, and thus couldn't be a rewritten
		#     parent. This is actually why merge explicitly doesn't invert splitting
		#     of all commits, it only inverts splitting of ancestors of HEAD, at the
		#     cost of the potentially surprising cherry-pick-like commits described
		#     in the README.
		#   + [FN2]: augh, this takes more than a dozen lines: looping over each
		#     parent, read the tree for the (rewritten) parent into the index, delete
		#     "path/to/sub/" from the index, and then if this is the first parent,
		#     set a variable to the hash of the index, else check that the hash of
		#     the index matches the stored hash (use default Main tree if not).
		#   + [FN3]: if there's multiple merge bases between SPLIT_HEAD and
		#     $assimilatee, just use HEAD (can't conflict with itself). However, if
		#     there's a unique merge base between SPLIT_HEAD and $assimilatee, the
		#     Main commit it was split from (as an ancestor of SPLIT_HEAD, musta' been
		#     split from something) will be *the* merge base between HEAD and
		#     ASSIMILATE_HEAD when they're merged, so its tree is guaranteed not to
		#     result in merge conflicts (empty diff against itself, after all), and is
		#     an ancestor of HEAD so hopefully is closer to when $assimilatee actually
		#     diverged from the subhistory of Sub in HEAD. In fact, this does exactly
		#     the right thing in a common use case: say Sub is some subhistory in Main
		#     (split out or merged in, doesn't matter), and after some changes to Main
		#     a new Sub commit is split out and merged into Sub, and then commits are
		#     added on top of that merge commit that we want to merge back into Main.
		#     We're going to have to assimilate a merge commit whose parents' Main
		#     trees are different ("some changes to Main" happened between them), but
		#     one is a descendant of the other so there's an obvious right merge base
		#     Main tree, which is exactly what we use.
